# 🧠 Ad Click Classification using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a user will click on an online advertisement based on demographic and behavioral data. Multiple classification algorithms are implemented and compared.

---

## 📌 Objective

To build accurate machine learning models that classify user click behavior and help businesses optimize ad targeting.
